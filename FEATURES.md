This will be a component/module that can be added to your existing projects to provide a calendar compatibility.

The features _might_ be as follows:
- A basic full page calendar which defaults to current date time
- You can choose to disable a few days based on an input
- You can choose to disable a few days based on the weekday
- Clicking on one of the days will expand the day with the possible times available during the day
